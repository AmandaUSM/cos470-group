## Stephen Houser
The winter break was a bit cold this year which scuttled my holiday skiing plans. The frigid temperatures felt like living in an icebox. So instead of skiing, I packaged up my family and transported them to [San Antonio Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio) to attend [PAX South](http://south.paxsite.com) a very large gaming convention. We spent most of our time playing tabletop games, though there was a fair amount of video game action going on. I re-learned how to play [Magic The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) and acquired a few decks inclduing pre-release cards that were special for the event.
